# Rainfall-Prection-Using-Machine-Learning

This is a rainfall prediction project which aims to predict rainfall based on parameters like humidity,wind speed etc.
I have used randomclassifier algorithm which shows the highest accuracy with 100 nodes used.
machine_learning is python code for the project
weatherAUS is dataset I have downloaded from kaggle
